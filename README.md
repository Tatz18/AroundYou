AroundYou

searches places using google maps api

AroundYou is a lightweight web application based on google maps api v3.It allows you to locate places around you based on utlities like restaurants,hospitals,movies,etc.

You can start using the application by setting it up on a web server.

I have not added any key in the google maps request link and that restricts requests to 1000 per day.
